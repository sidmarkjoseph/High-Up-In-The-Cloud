    <p>
        build.sh, run.sh and clean.sh have DOS-style line endings and this does not work 
        when running these scripts on Linux.</p>
    <p>
        Please run dos2unix on these before attempting to use them.</p>
    <p>
        Please set Execute permission on these &quot;.sh&quot; files using &quot;chmod u+awx *.sh&quot;

    <p>
        JAX-WS introduces a dependency on the WSDL used to generate the stubs, and 
        requires the WSDL be present. If -wsdlLocation is specified, then WSDL must be 
        present in the exact location specified by -wsdlLocation when the stubs were 
        generated.</p>
    <p>
        Note: WSDL implies WSDL files and associated XSD files.</p>
    <p>
        For the purpose of the SDK, the -wsdlLocation is smsService.wsdl, and, the WSDL 
        is copied into the sms.jar so it is always available.</p>
    <p>
        This can be seen in the build.bat and build.sh files that are used to build the 
        samples.
